 JavaScript alerts, prompts and confirmations.
 WebDriver provides an API for working with the three types of native popup messages offered by JavaScript.
 These popups are styled by the browser and offer limited customisation.

                       JavaScript prompts:
                       Prompts are similar to confirm boxes,
                       except they also include a text input.
                       Similar to working with form elements,
                       you can use WebDriverâ€™s send keys to fill in a response.
                       This will completely replace the placeholder text.
                       Pressing the cancel button will not submit any text.
