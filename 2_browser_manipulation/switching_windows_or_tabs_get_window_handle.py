# Some test frameworks offer methods and annotations

# unittest teardown

def tearDown(self):
    self.driver.quit()

# try / finally:
# If not running WebDriver in a test context,
# you may consider using try / finally which is offered by most languages
# so that an exception will still clean up the WebDriver session:

# try:
# # WebDriver code here...
# finally:
#     driver.quit()

# with keyword:
# Pythonâ€™s WebDriver now supports the python context manager,
# which when using the with keyword can automatically quit the driver at the end of execution:
# with webdriver.Firefox() as driver:
#   # WebDriver code here...
# # WebDriver will automatically quit after indentation
